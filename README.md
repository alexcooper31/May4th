# May 4th, be with you!
 
## Star Wars Movie's Summary
 
> Basic React + Next website made with Typescript.
 
To run the project, remember to download/update the dependencies:
 
On your terminal run: `yarn` or `npm install`
 
To build and start the project locally, run `yarn dev` or `npm start dev` afterwards.
 
For this test, Star Wars themed, was coincidentally made on May 4th of 2021. It was a relatively easy test with no major roadblocks.
 
I've opted to use the Styled-Components library with it, as I was accustomed to when dealing with react, but in hindsight I believe it's use it's not longer as viable as it used to be, not to mention it has to go through some adaptation to work with Next, which already presented a useful CSS styling solution. From now on I'll opt to work with SCSS or SASS frames as I believe they are currently the best way to style websites.
 
Next's CSS styling looks very similar and useful, although the framework has changed and evolved a lot since the last I've used it, it really impressed me and made me excited to work with it. It worked surprisingly well and it has a very decent documentation, it was a pleasant experience, although I wish it had some extra routing features and configuration options. I hope those come soon as I found it pleasant to work with Next a lot more since my last contact with it.
 
If you have any questions, feel free to ask and/or contact me. I hope you find the code up to your standards and within or above your expectation!
